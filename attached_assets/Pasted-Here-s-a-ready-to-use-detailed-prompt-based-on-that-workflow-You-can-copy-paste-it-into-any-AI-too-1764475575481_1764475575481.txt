MASTER PROMPT: “AI Research & Strategy Workflow for a New Brand”

You are my AI Research & Strategy Assistant.
Your job is to help me design and launch a new brand by combining:
	1.	competitor research,
	2.	deep market research, and
	3.	structured analysis of all findings.

⸻

1️⃣ Context & Inputs

Use the following inputs as the base of your work:
	•	Business / brand idea: [DESCRIBE THE BUSINESS / SERVICE / PRODUCT]
	•	Target audience: [WHO IT'S FOR – AGE, PROFESSION, SEGMENTS]
	•	Main geography / market: [COUNTRY / CITY / REGION]
	•	Language(s): [LANGUAGES TO FOCUS ON]
	•	Main goal right now: [e.g., validate idea / find positioning / plan launch / content strategy]

Before you start, list any clarifying questions you have.
Ask them all at once in a concise list. After I answer, proceed.

2️⃣ Step One – Competitor & Alternatives Scan (Perplexity-style)

Act as if you are using an advanced web research engine.
	1.	Map the competitive space:
	•	Identify direct competitors providing the same or very similar service/product in the same market.
	•	Identify indirect competitors / alternatives (different solutions to the same problem).
	•	For each main competitor, capture briefly:
	•	Name + website
	•	What they sell (core offer)
	•	Their target audience
	•	Their pricing approach (cheap / mid / premium, or any specific price points you find)
	•	Their value proposition & positioning (what promise they lead with)
	•	Notable strengths & weaknesses
	2.	Output for this step:
	•	A table summarising the top 5–10 competitors.
	•	A short commentary answering:
	•	Who seems to dominate the space and why?
	•	What patterns do you see in how they position themselves?
	•	Where do you see obvious gaps or weaknesses?

⸻

3️⃣ Step Two – Deep Market Research (Gemini Deep Research-style)

Now go beyond competitors and do deep market research for this niche in this geography.
	1.	Market overview:
	•	Size and maturity of the market (qualitative if you lack hard numbers).
	•	Key trends, drivers, and changes in the last 2–3 years.
	•	Main customer segments and their needs/pain points.
	2.	Customer behaviour & objections:
	•	What customers usually want most from this type of service.
	•	Typical fears or doubts that stop them from buying.
	•	How they usually discover and choose providers (channels, touchpoints).
	3.	Opportunities:
	•	Underserved segments.
	•	Frustrations customers have with existing solutions.
	•	Openings for differentiation (speed, quality, guarantees, niche focus, language, UX, etc.).
	4.	Output for this step:
	•	A structured report with headings:
	•	Market Overview
	•	Customer Segments & Jobs-to-Be-Done
	•	Pain Points & Objections
	•	Trends & Opportunities
	•	Bullet points, not walls of text.

4️⃣ Step Three – Build a “Research Notebook” (NotebookLM-style)

Act as if you’re loading everything from Steps 2 and 3 into one research notebook.
	1.	Unify the knowledge:
	•	Combine competitor insights and market insights into a single coherent knowledge base.
	•	Highlight key recurring themes and contradictions.
	2.	Internal questioning (simulate me asking you):
	•	Ask yourself 8–12 smart questions that a founder should ask here, such as:
	•	What is the sharpest, most defensible positioning for this brand?
	•	What should we avoid copying from existing players?
	•	What promise would immediately stand out as credible and attractive?
	•	Answer each question using only the research you’ve already gathered. If something is uncertain, say so explicitly.
	3.	Output for this step:
	•	Section titled “Notebook Q&A – Strategic Findings”
	•	Each Q followed by a concise, insight-dense answer.

⸻

5️⃣ Step Four – Brand Direction & Strategy Blueprint

Now turn all of this into a practical strategy for the new brand.

Create the following sections:
	1.	Brand Core
	•	Suggested brand positioning statement (1–2 sentences).
	•	Tagline options (3–5 short options).
	•	Clear “who we are for” and “who we are NOT for”.
	2.	Value Proposition & Offers
	•	The main value proposition in plain language.
	•	2–4 core offers / packages (what’s included, who each is for, rough pricing tier: entry / standard / premium).
	3.	Differentiation Map
	•	Bullet-point list: “How we are different from typical competitors.”
	•	3–5 key differentiators ranked by impact.
	4.	Go-to-Market Outline
	•	Main channels to focus on (e.g., LinkedIn, Google Search, local partnerships, etc.) and why.
	•	5–10 content ideas tailored to the target market that show expertise and build trust.
	•	Suggested first 3–5 actions to take in the next 30 days.
	5.	Risks & Assumptions
	•	List of the most important assumptions we are making.
	•	The top 3–5 things we must validate quickly and how to test them (simple experiments or signals to look for).

⸻

6️⃣ Style & Constraints
	•	Use clear, simple business English.
	•	Be specific and practical, avoid vague advice.
	•	If data is uncertain or based on weak sources, clearly label it as estimate / assumption.
	•	Wherever useful, format results as:
	•	Bullet lists
	•	Short paragraphs
	•	Tables for comparison

At the end, give me a one-page executive summary that a busy founder could read in 3–5 minutes and immediately understand:
	•	Where the opportunity is,
	•	How this brand should position itself, and
	•	What we should do next.
