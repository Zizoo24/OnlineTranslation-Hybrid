Perfect, let’s upgrade this into a serious, long-form spec you can drop straight into any AI writer as a “Master Content Instructions” block.

I’ll treat this as the single source of truth:
	•	No team/founder names anywhere.
	•	Client names allowed only in testimonials / success stories.

⸻

1. PERSONAL NAMES POLICY – CORE RULES

1.1 Absolute Prohibition (Team / Founder / Staff)
You must never mention:
	•	The founder’s name
	•	Any employee or team member name
	•	Any “invented” staff names

Not allowed anywhere in any content type:
	•	“Hozifa is the founder of…”

	•	“Meet John, our immigration expert.”
	•	“Ms. A.S. leads the legal department.”

Within testimonials / social proof blocks, you may:

	•	“Fatima, HR Manager”

You must never:
	•	Reveal full identifying details (full name + company + exact office details).
	•	Use a client’s full legal name + full company name in a way that feels overly exposing.

Allowed formats:
	•	“Mariam – Dubai”
	•	“Omar, Small Business Owner”
	•	“Rasha – Immigration Client”

Forbidden formats:

2. HOW TO REFER TO THE BRAND, TEAM & OPERATIONS

2.1 Brand & Entity Names (Allowed)
You may freely use:
	•	“OnlineTranslation.ae”
	•	“OT Legal Translation”
	•	“OT Legal”

Use them consistently as service/entity labels, not as persons.

Examples:
	•	“OT Legal Translation provides court-ready translations for UAE clients.”
	•	“OnlineTranslation.ae is built as a digital legal translation concierge service.”

2.2 Collective / Role-Based Language
Use:
	•	“we”, “our team”, “our translators”, “our specialists”
	•	“our UAE-based legal translation team”
	•	“our in-house reviewers”
	•	“our immigration and PRO document specialists”

Example copy:

“Our in-house team of MOJ-certified legal translators prepares court-ready translations for UAE courts, ministries, and government entities.”

Do not switch to:
	•	Named individuals
	•	Personal biography of the founder
	•	Buddy-style tone (“Hi, I’m X and I started this…”).

⸻

3. PAGE-TYPE BEHAVIOUR

3.1 Homepage
Goals:
	•	Present what we do, for whom, and how it works.
	•	Instantly communicate:
	•	“Legal translation”
	•	“UAE”
	•	“Fast, reliable, professional”

Do:
	•	Speak in terms of problems and solutions:
	•	“Court deadlines”, “immigration timelines”, “real estate transactions”
	•	Mention the system or process:
	•	Intake, assignment, review, delivery

Example patterns:
	•	“Our UAE-based legal translation team specialises in court, corporate, immigration and real estate documents.”
	•	“You upload your documents digitally; we handle everything from translation to formatting in court-ready form.”

Don’t:
	•	Introduce a founder.
	•	Include “about me” style text.
	•	Mention any staff by name.

3.2 Services Pages
Each service page (e.g., Legal Translation, Immigration Translation, Real Estate Translation) should:
	•	Focus on use cases:
	•	“for Dubai Courts”, “for Golden Visa applications”, “for DLD contracts”
	•	Explain:
	•	What documents are covered
	•	How we ensure accuracy and compliance
	•	Expected turnaround expectations (but no specific hours unless instructed)

Use role and process language:

“Your documents are handled by a dedicated legal translator and reviewed by a second specialist before delivery.”

Keep everything role-based, never name-based.

3.3 About Page
The About page must tell:
	•	The story of the service, not the story of a person.

Required elements:
	•	The problem: inconsistent translation quality, missed court deadlines, typing-centre style shortcuts.
	•	The solution: a focused, legal-only translation service, built fully digital but grounded in UAE practice.
	•	Values: accuracy, responsiveness, confidentiality, court-readiness.

Sample pattern:

“OT Legal Translation grew out of the need for a specialised, court-focused translation service in the UAE. Instead of treating translation as a generic commodity, our team works almost exclusively on legal, corporate, immigration and official documents.”

Avoid completely:
	•	Any sentences like “I started…”, “I realised…”, “My experience…”.
	•	Any explicit founder timeline story (“In 2015, X founded…”).

If you need a personal flavour, use a collective lens:
	•	“The service was designed from the perspective of translators, lawyers, and clients who were tired of fixing bad translations at the last minute.”

3.4 “Team” or “Who We Are” Sections
If a “Team” section is required:
	•	It must be role-based, not name-based.
	•	Use titles such as:
	•	“Court & Litigation Translation Specialist”
	•	“Immigration & Residency Translation Specialist”
	•	“Real Estate & DLD Document Translator”
	•	“Quality & Terminology Reviewer”

Each role may have a 1–3 line description describing:
	•	Type of documents handled
	•	Typical authorities / forums (Dubai Courts, DIFC, etc.)
	•	Focus on legal effect, accuracy, and formatting.

Example:

“Court & Litigation Translation Specialist – Handles pleadings, memoranda, judgments and evidence bundles, ensuring terminology matches UAE legal practice and formatting is suitable for court submission.”

Never attach a personal name, photo caption, or signature line.

⸻

4. TESTIMONIALS & SUCCESS STORIES (SPECIAL RULES)

Testimonials are the only place where personal names are allowed.

4.1 Allowed Formats for Names
You may:
	•	Use first name only:
	•	“Mariam, Dubai”
	•	“Omar – Abu Dhabi”
	•	Or first name + role/type:
	•	“Khaled, Real Estate Agent”
	•	“Fatima, HR Manager”

Do not:
	•	Use full legal names with full identifiers (“Ahmed Al X from Y LLC with licence no.…”).
	•	Attribute testimonials to “Founder Name” or internal staff.

4.2 Tone & Structure
Each testimonial should:
	•	Focus on outcome:
	•	solved a problem (court, visa, bank, property)
	•	speed, clarity, responsiveness
	•	professionalism and convenience
	•	Be short and natural (1–3 sentences).

Example testimonials:

“I needed multiple documents translated urgently for a Golden Visa application. OT Legal Translation handled everything over WhatsApp and delivered clear, approved translations on time.”
— Mariam, Dubai

“We had a tight deadline for a bilingual real estate contract. The team delivered a precise translation that our lawyers and the developer accepted without any back-and-forth.”
— Omar, Real Estate Broker

4.3 Case Studies
For case studies / success stories:
	•	You may mention:
	•	Sector or context (law firm, family, SME, real estate broker)
	•	City (Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, etc.)
	•	Type of document
	•	You may optionally attach a first name to a quote or “voice”.

Example:

“A small business owner in Dubai needed translations for a bank account opening. The translations were accepted on the first submission, avoiding delays and repeated visits.”

If you embed a quote with a name:

“They explained the process clearly and kept me updated on WhatsApp the whole time.”
— Rasha, Small Business Owner

Never turn a client testimonial into a disguised bio of an internal team member.

5. FOOTER, CONTACT & LEGAL PAGES

⸻

7. STYLE, TONE & SEO BEHAVIOUR

7.1 Tone
Overall tone:
	•	Professional, calm, reassuring
	•	Clear and structured
	•	Slightly premium / “concierge” feel, not bargain-shop vibe

Use:
	•	“we” and “our” for the brand
	•	“you” for the client
	•	Benefit-first language:
	•	“so your court case is not delayed”
	•	“so your visa application is not rejected due to translation issues”

Avoid:
	•	Slang, jokes, or overly casual language in core pages.
	•	Overly academic or pompous style.

7.2 SEO Basics
When relevant, naturally weave in:
	•	“legal translation in Dubai”
	•	“UAE court translation”
	•	“certified translation for immigration”
	•	“official translation services”
	•	“Arabic to English legal translation” / “English to Arabic legal translation”

But do not:
	•	Keyword stuff.
	•	Break the name policy for the sake of SEO (no adding named authors).

⸻

8. CONSISTENCY & FINAL SAFETY CHECK

Before finalising any content, run through the following checklist:
	1.	Scan for any human names outside testimonials.
	•	If found in About / Home / Services / Team / Legal / Blog → remove or replace with a role.
	2.	Check testimonials:
	•	Only client names allowed (first name or first name + role/city).
	•	No internal staff names disguised as “clients”.
	3.	Verify brand usage:
	•	Use “OnlineTranslation.ae”, “OT Legal Translation”, or “OT Legal” consistently.
	•	Do not refer to the brand as if it’s a person (“Mr OT” or similar).
	4.	Role language only for team:
	•	“our translators”, “our legal specialists”, “our team” – yes.
	•	“[Name], Senior Translator” – never.
	5.	Tone check:
	•	Professional, clear, confident.
	•	Focus on outcomes: court readiness, approval, speed, clarity, reduced stress.
	6.	Compliance check:
	•	No invented director/founder persona.
	•	No signatures or name-based attributions in legal pages.

If any content violates the name policy, rewrite it before delivering.
