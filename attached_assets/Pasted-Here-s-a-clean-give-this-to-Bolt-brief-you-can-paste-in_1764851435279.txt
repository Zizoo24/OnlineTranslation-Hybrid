Here’s a clean “give-this-to-Bolt” brief you can paste in and then refine with repo details.

### Prompt for Bolt AI – Repo Cleanup, CSS Unification, and Vercel Cutover

You are my AI front-end assistant working on a **static HTML/CSS site** that will be deployed on **Vercel** (domain currently points to WordPress/Bluehost).

#### 1. Overall goals

1. Refine and finalize the new static pages (HTML/CSS/JS).
2. Clean and simplify the repo:

   * **One primary CSS file** for the site (plus any truly necessary vendor files).
   * Remove unused/duplicate CSS and old/unused pages/assets.
3. Ensure **layout consistency** across all pages:

   * Same **top bar / header / nav**, **sidebar (if present)**, and **footer**.
   * Repeated chunks (CTAs, hero patterns, etc.) must be visually and structurally unified.
4. Run a **basic QA pass** so there are no obvious code conflicts, broken layouts, or console errors.
5. Prepare the repo so it’s **safe to deploy to Vercel**.
6. Finally, help me plan the **domain shift + 301 redirects** from the old WordPress URLs to the new static URLs.

### 2. Repo audit & cleanup plan

Work through the repo in this order:

1. **Scan structure**

   * Identify:

     * All main HTML pages (e.g. `index.html`, `services.html`, `about.html`, etc.).
     * All CSS files.
     * Any JS files and assets folders (`/img`, `/assets`, `/js`, etc.).
   * Tell me, in plain English, what you see as the current structure and which parts look legacy/unused.

2. **Identify obviously unused files**

   * Look for:

     * Old template files that are never linked.
     * CSS files not referenced by any HTML.
   * Propose a **list of candidates** for deletion and ask for confirmation before you remove them.

3. **Unify layout blocks**

   * Choose a **single canonical version** for:

     * Header / top bar / navigation.
     * Sidebar (if used).
     * Footer.
   * Apply that canonical markup + class naming to all pages that should share that layout.
   * Make sure internal links (menu items) are correct and consistent across pages.

### 3. CSS consolidation

1. **Choose one main site CSS file**

   * Pick or create a single primary stylesheet (e.g. `styles.css` or `main.css`) that will contain all core layout + typography + color styles.
   * Keep only vendor/third-party CSS separate if absolutely needed (e.g. icons, sliders).

2. **Merge styles**

   * Move relevant rules from secondary CSS files into the main stylesheet.
   * Remove duplicates and conflicting declarations.
   * Normalize:

     * Color tokens.
     * Font stacks.
     * Heading/body sizes.
     * Spacing system (margin/padding scale).

3. **Update HTML references**

   * Ensure each HTML page only loads:

     * The main site CSS.
     * Any strictly necessary vendor CSS.
   * Remove `<link>` tags to CSS files that you have merged or removed.

4. **Delete dead CSS**

   * Once styles are merged and pages tested:

     * Remove unused CSS files from the repo.
   * Confirm which files were removed.

### 4. Page refinement & QA

On all main pages:

1. **HTML sanity**

   * Fix any obvious structural issues:

     * Missing `<title>`, broken `<head>` tags, mismatched tags.
     * Broken `<a>` links (e.g. pointing to non-existent pages).
   * Keep HTML **semantic** where reasonable (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, etc.).

2. **Visual consistency**

   * Ensure headings, paragraphs, buttons, and cards use consistent classes and spacing.
   * Make sure repeated components (hero sections, CTA strips, testimonials, etc.) match across pages.

3. **Responsiveness**

   * Check common breakpoints:

     * Mobile portrait (~375–414px).
     * Tablet (~768px).
     * Desktop (≥ 1200px).
   * Fix any obvious layout breaks (overflow, overlapping text, unusable nav).

4. **Console & basic performance**

   * Make sure there are **no JavaScript errors** in the console.
   * Don’t add heavy libraries unnecessarily.
   * If you see very large images, suggest more efficient sizing or formats (WebP) but don’t rewrite everything at once without asking.

### 5. Vercel readiness

1. **Static hosting assumptions**

   * Confirm that the site is static:

     * HTML, CSS, and JS only.
     * No server-side PHP or WordPress dependencies.
   * If there is any build step (e.g. bundler), describe it and ensure it’s minimal.

2. **Project root**

   * Confirm what folder Vercel should serve:

     * If it’s the repo root (HTML files in root), say so.
     * If there’s a `dist/` or `build/` folder, specify that and ensure the build command is correct.

3. **Configuration**

   * If appropriate, create/update a minimal `vercel.json` for:

     * Project root.
     * Redirects (see next section).
   * Do not introduce advanced features unless asked; keep config simple and documented in comments.

### 6. 301 redirects & domain shift (WordPress → static site on Vercel)

I will provide (or we will construct together) a mapping of:

* **Old WordPress URLs** → **New static URLs**

Your job:

1. **Create a redirect map**

   * Draft a list of `{source: old_path, destination: new_path}` pairs based on:

     * Likely old WP slugs.
     * Any mapping I give you from Google Search Console / memory.

2. **Implement 301s in `vercel.json`**

   * Add a `redirects` block like:

   ```json
   {
     "redirects": [
       {
         "source": "/old-wordpress-slug/",
         "destination": "/new-static-page/",
         "permanent": true
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   * Use **trailing slashes** consistently with how the new site is structured.

3. **Check for conflicts**

   * Make sure:

     * There are no redirect loops.
     * No two redirects fight over the same `source`.
     * All redirected destinations actually exist as pages on the static site.

4. **Post-deployment checklist (for me)**

   * Remind me to:

     * Update DNS so the domain points to Vercel.
     * Verify the domain in Vercel.
     * Test key old URLs in the browser and confirm they 301 correctly to new pages.

### 7. How I want you to work

* Work in **small, clear steps**:

  * First: report current structure.
  * Then: suggest a cleanup/unification plan.
  * Then: apply changes in batches (CSS, layout, redirects), explaining what you’re changing.
* Avoid breaking existing working pages:

  * If something is risky, propose the change and wait for confirmation.
* When you finish a big step (CSS unification, layout unification, redirects), give me:

  * A short summary of what you changed.
  * Any follow-up checks I should run (e.g. “test these pages on mobile/desktop”).

Use this plan as your roadmap to get the repo **clean, unified, and ready for Vercel**, while preserving SEO via 301 redirects from the old WordPress URLs.
